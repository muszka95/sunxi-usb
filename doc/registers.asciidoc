Sun7i M-USB registers
=====================
Tommie Gannert

Terminology
-----------
Each register is marked with the offset from the base, whether it is read or write and if it is part of the standard MUSB driver.


Base addresses
--------------
USBC0 is at 0x01C13_0000.


POWER/PCTL (0x0040)
-------------------
Read/Write, MUSB

Allwinner calls it `PCTL`, while MUSB says `POWER`.

[options="header"]
|======================================
|Bits |R/W|Name            |Description
|   7 |RW |ISO_UPDATE_EN   |Only device, ???
|   6 |RW |SOFT_CONNECT    |Only device, 1 to connect to bus, 0 to be disconnected. This likely directly disconnects the DATA pull-ups.
|   5 |RW |HIGH_SPEED_EN   |Enable HS transfers. Probably by allowing the K chirp on reset, and looking at the hub response.
|   4 |R  |HIGH_SPEED_FLAG |1 if HS is supported by the hub. This is probably established during the RESET phase. If not, the device is at FS.
|   3 |RW |RESET           |1 to keep USBC in RESET mode.
|   2 |RW |RESUME          |1 to wake USBC from SUSPEND. Likely auto-resets to 0.
|   1 |RW |SUSPEND         |1 to put the device into SUSPEND.
|   0 |RW |SUSPEND_EN      |Enable suspend logic ???
|======================================


INTTx (0x0044)
--------------
Read, MUSB

Each endpoint has one bit indicating whether transmission of a new packet is possible. The register is reset upon read (see `musb_generic_disable()`.)


INTRx (0x0046)
--------------
Read, MUSB

Each endpoint has one bit indicating whether new data is available for reading. The register is reset on read (see `musb_generic_disable()`.) EP0 uses CSR0 instead and bit 0 is not defined.


INTTxE (0x0048)
--------------
Read/Write, MUSB

Each endpoint has one bit indicating whether interrupts for INTTx should be enabled or not.


INTRxE (0x004A)
--------------
Read/Write, MUSB

Each endpoint has one bit indicating whether interrupts for INTTx should be enabled or not. EP0 uses ??? instead and bit 0 is not defined.


INTUSB (0x004C)
---------------

Write a 1 to clear a bit.


FADDR (0x0098)
--------------
Read/Write, MUSB

For host mode: The address to receive from, or transmit to.

For device mode: The address of the device, or 0 if not yet set.
